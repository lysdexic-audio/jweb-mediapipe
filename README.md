# jweb-mediapipe
Examples demonstrating how to load the [Mediapipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) libraries in Max's **jweb** object. Sometimes even using them to control a horrible synth.

Examples based on https://github.com/LintangWisesa/MediaPipe-in-JavaScript

Seem to be using an older mediapipe API.
