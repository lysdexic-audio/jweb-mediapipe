# jweb-mediapipe
Barebones example of loading the [Mediapipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) Hands library in Max's **jweb** object and using it to control a horrible synth.

Examples based on https://github.com/LintangWisesa/MediaPipe-in-JavaScript

Seem to be using an older mediapipe API.
